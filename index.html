  <h1>Security & Privacy Evaluations</h1>

  <p>
     Below lies a list of analyses regarding security and privacy-focused topics. The security assessments make no
     attempt at evaluating security based on the number of former vulnerabilities in a particular program. Instead,
     criteria involve the software's overall security posture and ease of exploitation. Primarily, the assessments
     include an analysis of the software's attack surface exposure, as well as the adoption of modern defensive
     techniques. In particular, they study the deployed exploit mitigations and the extent to which different parts
     of the software are compartmentalised, as is necessary to reduce the potential harm a successful exploit
     could produce. Note that these analyses are purely objective and do not account for threat models or other
     user-dependent factors. <br>
     <br>
     Likewise, the privacy evaluations are focused on meaningful approaches to achieving privacy, rather than incomplete
     and misguided approaches, as is common elsewhere. It is important to create a clear distinction between privacy and
     security to avoid conflating the subjects of any particular article.

    My name is "madaidan". I'm a security researcher <a href="https://github.com/madaidan">who works on
    various open source projects</a>, mainly <a href="https://www.whonix.org/">Whonix</a>. My website
    provides information on security and privacy-related topics — it aims to highlight security issues
    within popular technology, debunk misinformation and provide free security guidance for everyone. This
    website was created by me, with help from concat and a few other friends. <br>
