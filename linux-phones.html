    <h2 id="comparison"><a href="#comparison">Comparison with Other Phones</a></h2>

    <p>
      Linux phones, such as the Librem 5 or Pinephone, are a major degradation from traditional mobile operating systems,
      such as Android or iOS. A few of the points in this article do apply to the Librem 5 specifically, but the majority
      applies to any Linux phone unless specified otherwise. <br>
      <br>
      Linux phones lack any significant security model and the points from the <a href="linux.html">Linux article</a> apply to
      Linux phones fully. There is not yet a single Linux phone with a sane security model. They do not have modern security
      features, such as full system MAC policies, verified boot, strong app sandboxing, modern exploit mitigations and so on
      which modern Android phones already deploy. <br>
      <br>
      Distributions like PureOS are not particularly secure. They are mostly a reskinned Debian and do not include substantial
      hardening. While AppArmor is enabled, the majority of processes still run unconfined so that is mostly negligible. PureOS
      <a href="https://source.puri.sm/pureos/packages/pureos-security-hardening">changes a few security-relevant settings</a>, but
      these are also mostly negligible:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        PureOS does not apply the exec-shield patch so that sysctl doesn't even exist in the first place.
      </li>

      <li>
        The purpose of disabling kexec is to prevent root from booting a malicious kernel, but <a
        href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">root can do so many other things to modify the kernel</a>, such as loading a
        kernel module.
      </li>

      <li>
        Attempting to hide kernel symbols via <code>kptr_restrict</code> ignores the fact that they're clearly visible in
        the <code>System.map</code> file on disk, <a href="guides/linux-hardening.html#sysctl-kernel">among</a> <a
        href="guides/linux-hardening.html#other-kernel-pointer-leaks">other</a> <a
        href="guides/linux-hardening.html#kernel-self-compilation">sources</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        And finally, disabling source routing is already a Debian default.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      PureOS also uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux-libre">linux-libre</a>. This will prevent the user
      from loading any proprietary firmware updates which just so happens to be almost all of them. <a
      href="https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-solving-the-first-fsf-ryf-hurdle/">The Librem 5 prevents the user from updating
      new firmware even with an alternative kernel</a> which forces the user to use outdated and insecure firmware with
      known vulnerabilities. <br>
      <br>
      The hardware itself lacks many modern security features too, such as <a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/">
      proper verified boot</a>, <a href="https://source.android.com/security/keystore/">a hardware-backed keystore</a>
      (some PGP smartcard is not equivalent) and more. <br>
      <br>
      Although one way to fix the issues in software would be to install a more sane OS like Android or its derivatives,
      such as GrapheneOS, if support for the hardware was added. Keep in mind though that it would still lack important
      hardware and firmware security features like verified boot so it still isn't close to a normal Android device. <br>
      <br>
      These devices are also not open hardware/firmware unlike what they try to imply. The majority of the
      hardware/firmware is still proprietary.
    </p>

    <h2 id="hardware-kill-switches"><a href="#hardware-kill-switches">Hardware Kill Switches</a></h2>

    <p>
      Hardware kill switches are nothing but marketing frills. <br>
      <br>
      The microphone kill switch is useless since audio can still be gotten via the sensors (such as the <a
      href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/gyrophone/files/gyromic.pdf">gyroscope</a> or <a
      href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3309074.3309076">accelerometer</a>). While the Librem 5 does have a "lockdown
      mode" that disables the sensors, it also requires flipping all of the other switches, including the network switches
      which effectively turns your device into a brick just to prevent audio recording. <br>
      <br>
      The network kill switch has two primary threat models: preventing cell tower triangulation or preventing data exfiltration
      after the device has been compromised. The switch is useless in either of these threat models:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        To prevent cell tower triangulation, you can simply enable airplane mode and it is just as effective.
      </li>

      <li>
        The network kill switch is useless for preventing data exfiltration since the attacker can just wait until you toggle
        the switch on again to exfiltrate data. If you need to temporarily disable network access, you can use airplane mode.
        Airplane mode can be disabled via a software vulnerability, but if an attacker has those capabilities already, then
        they can also simply sit and record any sensitive data and eventually upload it once you re-enable the hardware network
        kill switch, making it no more effective than airplane mode.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The camera kill switch can be useful as a small usability improvement, but it is really no better than some tape.
    </p>

    <h2 id="modem-isolation"><a href="#modem-isolation">Modem Isolation</a></h2>

    <p>
      Modem isolation isn't anything special. For example, <a
      href="https://i.blackhat.com/USA-19/Thursday/us-19-Pi-Exploiting-Qualcomm-WLAN-And-Modem-Over-The-Air-wp.pdf">Qualcomm
      SoCs have isolated the modem via an IOMMU for years</a>, among others. The unorthodox way in which the Librem 5 attempts
      to isolate the modem is via the Linux kernel USB stack which is not a strong barrier as shown in the <a href="linux.html">
      Linux article</a>. <br>
      <br>
      There is also a lot of misinformation about how the modem being on a separate chip means it's isolated â€” this is
      completely untrue. Just look at how FireWire for example can be <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394#Security_issues">abused for DMA</a> while being completely separate
      from the rest of the hardware. Whether or not the modem is on a separate chip is irrelevant to if it's isolated.
