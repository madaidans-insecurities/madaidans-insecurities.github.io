  <h2 id="comparison"><a href="#comparison">Comparison with Other Phones</a></h2>

  <p>
    Linux phones such as the Librem 5 or Pinephone are a major degradation from alternative operating systems such as
    Android or iOS. A few of the points in this article do apply to the Librem 5 specifically but the majority applies
    to any Linux phone unless specified otherwise. <br>
    <br>
    Linux phones lack any significant security model and the points from the <a href="linux.html">Linux article</a> apply to
    Linux phones fully. There is not yet a single Linux phone with a sane security model. They do not have modern security
    features such as full system MAC policies, verified boot, strong app sandboxing, modern exploit mitigations and so on
    which modern Android phones already deploy. <br>
    <br>
    Distributions like PureOS are not particularly secure. They are mostly a reskinned Debian.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="lilist">
      AppArmor is enabled but the majority of processes still run unconfined so it's mostly negligible.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      PureOS <a
      href="https://source.puri.sm/pureos/packages/pureos-security-hardening">changes a few security-relevant
      settings</a> but these are also mostly negligible:
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      They don't apply the exec-shield patch so that sysctl doesn't even exist in the first place;
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      The purpose of disabling kexec is to prevent root from booting a malicious kernel but root can do so many other
      things to modify the kernel such as loading a kernel module;
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      Hiding kernel symbols from <code>/proc</code> ignores
      the fact that they're clearly visible in System.map;
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      And finally, disabling source routing is already a Debian default.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      PureOS also uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux-libre">linux-libre</a>. This will prevent you
      from loading any proprietary firmware updates which just so happens to be almost all of them. <a
      href="https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-solving-the-first-fsf-ryf-hurdle/">Librem 5 prevents you from even flashing
      new firmware manually</a> which forces you to use outdated and insecure firmware with known vulnerabilities.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The hardware itself lacks many modern security features too such as <a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/">
    proper verified boot</a>, <a href="https://source.android.com/security/keystore/">a hardware-backed keystore</a>
    (some PGP smartcard is not equivalent) and more. <br>
    <br>
    Although, one way to fix the issues in software would be to install a more sane OS like Android or its derivatives
    such as GrapheneOS if support for the hardware was added. Keep in mind though that it would still lack important
    hardware and firmware security features like verified boot so it still isn't close to a normal Android device. <br>
    <br>
    These devices are also not open hardware/firmware unlike what they try to imply. The majority of the
    hardware/firmware is still proprietary.

  <h2 id="hardware-kill-switches"><a href="#hardware-kill-switches">Hardware Kill Switches</a></h2>

  <p>
    Hardware kill switches are nothing but marketing frills. <br>
    <br>
    The microphone kill switch is useless since audio can still be gotten via the sensors (such as the <a
    href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/gyrophone/files/gyromic.pdf">gyroscope</a> or <a
    href="https://venetosmani.com/publications/Speech_Activity_Detection_Using_Accelerometer_IEEE_EMBC_2012.pdf">
    accelerometer</a>). While the Librem 5 does have a "lockdown mode" that disables the sensors, it also requires
    flipping all of the other switches, including the network switches which effectively turns your device into a brick
    just to prevent audio recording. <br>
    <br>
    The network kill switch has two primary threat models: preventing cell tower triangulation or preventing data exfiltration
    after the device has been compromised. The switch is useless in either of these threat models:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="lilist">
      To prevent cell tower triangulation, you can simply enable airplane mode and it is just as effective.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      The network kill switch is useless for preventing data exfiltration since the attacker can just wait until you toggle
      the switch on again to exfiltrate data. If you need to temporarily disable network access, you can use airplane mode.
      Airplane mode can be disabled via a software vulnerability but if an attacker has those capabilities already, then
      they can also simply sit and record any sensitive data and eventually upload it once you re-enable the hardware network
      kill switch, making it no more effective than airplane mode.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The camera kill switch can be useful as a small usability improvement but it is really no better than some tape.
  </p>

  <h2 id="modem-isolation"><a href="#modem-isolation">Modem Isolation</a></h2>

  <p>
    Modem isolation isn't anything special. Qualcomm SoCs have isolated the modem via an IOMMU <a
      href="https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-27/dc-27-speakers.html#Gong">for years</a>. The way the Librem 5 isolates
    the modem is via the Linux kernel USB stack which is not a strong barrier as shown in the <a href="linux.html">Linux
      article</a>. <br>
    <br>
    There is also a lot of misinformation about how the modem being on a separate chip means it's isolated â€” this is
    completely untrue. Just look at how FireWire for example can be <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394#Security_issues">abused for DMA</a> while being completely separate
    from the rest of the hardware. Whether or not the modem is on a separate chip is irrelevant to if it's isolated.
