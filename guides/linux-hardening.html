      <a href="../linux.html">Linux is not a secure operating system</a>. However, there are steps you can take to improve it. This guide aims to explain
      how to harden Linux as much as possible for security and privacy. This guide attempts to be distribution-agnostic and is not tied to any specific one. <br>
      <br>
      DISCLAIMER: Do not attempt to apply anything in this article if you do not know exactly what you are doing. This guide is focused purely on security and privacy â€”
      not performance, usability or anything else. This guide is not intended to be followed exactly â€” readers must examine their own threat model and decide which
      steps to apply. This guide is also not meant to attack a particular group of people or software. Certain software is recommended against in this guide due to
      security concerns, but this is not out of disdain. At its core, hardening is reducing the ways in which your system can be attacked. Under some threat models,
      the attack surface presented by a specific program may be too large to be acceptable. Whether or not this is applicable to you depends on your personal threat
      model. <br>

      All commands listed in this guide will require root privileges. Words beginning with "$" sign indicate a variable that may differ between users as to suit their

    <h2 id="choosing-the-right-distro"><a href="#choosing-the-right-distro">1. Choosing the right Linux distribution</a></h2>

    <p>
      There are many factors that go into choosing a good Linux distribution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li class="lilist">
        Avoid distributions that freeze packages, as <a href="../linux.html#stable-release-models">they are often quite behind on security updates</a>.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        Use a distribution with an init system other than <a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a>.
        systemd contains a lot of unnecessary attack surface and <a href="https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/how_to_crash_systemd_in_one_tweet">inserts a
        considerable amount of complexity into the most privileged user space component</a>; <a href="https://ewontfix.com/14/">it attempts to do far
        more things than necessary</a> and goes beyond what an init system should do. An init system should not need many lines of code to function properly.
        While a common argument in favour of systemd is its ability to sandbox system services, this can be replicated on other init systems through
        sandboxing utilities like bubblewrap, <a href="#sandboxing">as documented below</a>.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        Use <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a> as the default C library. musl is heavily focused on minimality, which <a
        href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/90147#issuecomment-643473182">results in very small attack surface</a>, whereas other C libraries
        such as glibc are overly complex and prone to vulnerabilities. For example, <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=glibc">
        over a hundred vulnerabilities in glibc have been publicly disclosed</a>, compared to the <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=musl">
        very few in musl</a>. While counting CVEs by itself is often an inaccurate statistic, in this case, it represents an overarching issue and is
        symptomatic of underlying security issues. musl also has invested in <a href="https://www.dustri.org/b/security-features-of-musl.html">decent exploit mitigations</a>,
        particularly its <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/05/13/1">hardened memory allocator</a>, heavily inspired by GrapheneOS' hardened_malloc.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        Preferably use a distribution that utilises <a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> by default rather than <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">
        OpenSSL</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/openssl-code-beyond-repair-claims-creator-of-libressl-fork/">OpenSSL contains
        tremendous amounts of totally unnecessary attack surface and follows poor security practices</a>. For example, it still maintains OS/2 and VMS support â€”
        ancient operating systems that are multiple decades old. These abhorrent security practices are what led to the dreaded <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed vulnerability</a>. LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL by the OpenBSD team that applies
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreSSL#Changes">superior programming practices</a> and <a href="https://opensslrampage.org/">eradicates
        a lot of attack surface</a>. Within LibreSSL's first year, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/libtls-fsec-2015/mgp00005.html">it mitigated a
        large number of vulnerabilities, including a few high severity ones</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The best distribution to use as a base for your hardened operating system would be <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a>, as it allows you to configure
      your system exactly how you want it to be, which will be extremely useful, especially when we come to <a href="#hardened-compilation-flags">more secure compilation
      flags</a> later in the guide. <br>
      <br>
      However, Gentoo may not be feasible for many people due to its significant usability pitfalls. In this case, <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>'s musl
      build or <a href="https://www.alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a> would be a good compromise.
    </p>

    <h2 id="kernel"><a href="#kernel">2. Kernels</a></h2>

    <p>
      The kernel is the core of the operating system and is unfortunately very prone to attacks. As Brad Spengler has once said, <a
      href="https://grsecurity.net/huawei_hksp_introduces_trivially_exploitable_vulnerability">it can be thought of as the largest,
      most vulnerable setuid root binary on the system</a>. Thus, it is very important for the kernel to be hardened as much as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="stable-vs-lts"><a href="#stable-vs-lts">2.1 Stable vs. LTS kernels</a></h3>

    <p>
      The Linux kernel is released under two main forms: stable and long-term support (LTS). Stable releases are more recent, whereas LTS
      releases are an older stable release that is being supported for a long time. <a href="https://www.grsecurity.net/the_truth_about_linux_4_6">
      There are many consequences to choosing either of the aforementioned releases</a>. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://grsecurity.net/reports_of_cves_death_greatly_exaggerated">The Linux kernel does not use CVEs to identify security
      vulnerabilities properly</a>. This means that fixes for most security vulnerabilities are not able to be backported to LTS kernels;
      but stable releases contain all security fixes made so far. <br>
      <br>
      With those fixes, however, a stable kernel includes a lot more new features, therefore vastly increasing the attack surface of the
      kernel and introducing a large amount of new bugs. On the contrary, LTS kernels have less attack surface because these features are
      not being constantly added. <br>
      <br>
      Additionally, stable kernels include newer hardening features to mitigate certain exploits which LTS kernels do not. A few examples
      of such features are the <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">Lockdown LSM</a> and <a
      href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2018/11/04/stackleak.html">STACKLEAK GCC plugin</a>. <br>
      <br>
      To conclude, there is a trade-off when choosing a stable or LTS kernel. LTS kernels have less hardening features and not all public bug fixes
      at that point have been backported, but it generally has less attack surface and potentially a smaller chance of introducing unknown bugs.
      Stable kernels have more hardening features and all known bug fixes are included, but it also has more attack surface and greater chances of
      introducing more unknown bugs. In the end though, a more recent LTS branch, such as the 4.19 kernel, would be preferred due to the much smaller
      attack surface.
    </p>

    <h3 id="sysctl"><a href="#sysctl">2.2 Sysctl</a></h3>

    <p>
      Sysctl is a tool that allows the user to configure certain kernel settings and enable various security features or disable dangerous
      features to reduce attack surface. To change settings temporarily you can execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sysctl -w $tunable = $value</code></pre>

    <p>
      To change sysctls permanently, you can add the one you want to change to <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> or the corresponding files within
      <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>, depending on your Linux distribution. <br>
      <br>
      Since Linux 5.8, <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/97e9c8eb4bb1dc57859acb1338dfddbd967d7484/Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt#L5681-L5688">
      sysctls can also be set</a> via the <code>sysctl.$tunable=$value</code> <a href="#boot-parameters">boot parameter</a>. This may be better,
      as it is set at the beginning of the boot process, without depending on a user space service to read the values from configuration files. <br>
      <br>
      The following are the recommended sysctl settings that you should change.
    </p>

    <h4 id="sysctl-kernel"><a href="#sysctl-kernel">2.2.1 Kernel self-protection</a></h4>

    <pre><code>kernel.kptr_restrict=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      A kernel pointer points to a specific location in kernel memory. <a href="https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Bug_Classes/Kernel_pointer_leak">
      These can be very useful in exploiting the kernel</a>, but kernel pointers are not hidden by default â€” it is easy to uncover them by, for example,
      reading the contents of <code>/proc/kallsyms</code>. This setting aims to mitigate kernel pointer leaks. Alternatively, you can set
      <code>kernel.kptr_restrict=1</code> to only hide kernel pointers from processes without the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.dmesg_restrict=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg">dmesg</a> is the kernel log. It exposes a large amount of useful kernel debugging information, but this
      can often leak sensitive information, such as kernel pointers. Changing the above sysctl restricts the kernel log to the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.printk=3 3 3 3</code></pre>

    <p>
      Despite the value of <code>dmesg_restrict</code>, the kernel log will still be displayed in the console during boot. Malware that is
      able to record the screen during boot may be able to abuse this to gain higher privileges. This option prevents those information
      leaks. This must be used in combination with certain boot parameters <a href="#boot-kernel">described below</a> to be fully effective.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1
net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="../linux.html#kernel">eBPF exposes quite large attack surface</a>. As such, it must be restricted. These sysctls restrict eBPF
      to the <code>CAP_BPF</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> (<code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> on kernel versions prior to 5.8) and enable
      JIT hardening techniques, such as <a
      href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9e4b0d55d84a66dbfede56890501dc96e696059c/include/linux/filter.h#L1039-L1070">constant blinding</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>dev.tty.ldisc_autoload=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      This <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/15/890">restricts loading TTY line disciplines</a> to the <code>CAP_SYS_MODULE</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> to prevent unprivileged attackers from loading vulnerable line disciplines with the <code>TIOCSETD</code>
      ioctl, which <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">has been abused in a number of exploits before</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd()</a></code> syscall is <a
      href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cefdca0a86be517bc390fc4541e3674b8e7803b0">often</a> <a
      href="https://duasynt.com/blog/linux-kernel-heap-spray">abused</a> to exploit use-after-free flaws. Due to this, this sysctl is used to restrict
      this syscall to the <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec is a system call that is used to boot another kernel during runtime</a>. This functionality can
      be abused to load a malicious kernel and gain arbitrary code execution in kernel mode, so this sysctl disables it.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.sysrq=4</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">SysRq key</a> exposes a lot of potentially dangerous debugging functionality
      to unprivileged users. Contrary to common assumptions, SysRq is not only an issue for physical attacks, as <a href="https://github.com/xairy/unlockdown">
      it can also be triggered remotely</a>. The value of this sysctl makes it so that a user can only use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SAK.txt">
      secure attention key</a>, which will be necessary for <a href="#accessing-root-securely">accessing root securely</a>. Alternatively, you can simply set the
      value to <code>0</code> to disable SysRq completely.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      User namespaces are a feature in the kernel which aim to improve sandboxing and make it easily accessible for unprivileged users. However, <a
      href="../linux.html#kernel">this feature exposes significant kernel attack surface for privilege escalation</a>, so this sysctl restricts the
      usage of user namespaces to the <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>. For unprivileged sandboxing,
      it is instead recommended to use a setuid binary with little attack surface to minimise the potential for privilege escalation. This topic is
      covered further in the <a href="#application-sandboxing">sandboxing section</a>. <br>
      <br>
      Be aware though that this sysctl only exists on certain Linux distributions, as it requires a kernel patch. If your kernel does not include
      this patch, you can alternatively disable user namespaces completely (including for root) by setting <code>user.max_user_namespaces=0</code>.

    <h3 id="boot-parameters"><a href="#boot-parameters">2.3 Boot parameters</a></h3>

    <p>
      Boot parameters pass settings to the kernel at boot using your bootloader. Some settings can be used to increase security,
      similar to sysctl. Bootloaders often differ in how boot parameters are set. A few examples are listed below, but you should
      research the required steps for your specific bootloader.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>If using GRUB as your bootloader, edit <code>/etc/default/grub</code>, and add your parameters to the <code>
      GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=</code> line.</li>
      <li>If using Syslinux, edit <code>/boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg</code>, and add them to the <code>APPEND</code> line.</li>
      <li>If using systemd-boot, edit your loader entry, and append them to the end of the <code>linux</code> line.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The following settings are recommended to increase security. <br>
      <br>
      This section originally recommended to apply various <code>slub_debug</code> options; however, due to <a
      href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/792702911f581f7793962fbeb99d5c3a1b28f4c3">Linux deciding to implicitly

      longer be recommended. Users are instead advised to use <code>init_on_free</code> as a replacement for memory poisoning
      and linux-hardened's slab canaries in place of redzoning. If <code>slub_debug</code> is in use for anything other than
      debugging, it is highly recommended to remove it immediately.

    <pre><code>oops=panic</code></pre>

    <p>
      Sometimes certain kernel exploits will cause what is known as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel_oops">"oops"</a>. This parameter will cause the kernel to panic on
      such oopses, thereby preventing those exploits. However, sometimes bad drivers cause harmless oopses which would result in your system crashing, meaning this boot parameter can only
      be used on certain hardware.
    </p>

    <pre><code>module.sig_enforce=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      This only allows kernel modules that have been signed with a valid key to be loaded, which increases security by making it much harder to load a malicious kernel module. This prevents
      all out-of-tree kernel modules, including DKMS modules from being loaded <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/module-signing.html">unless you have signed them</a>,
      meaning that modules such as the VirtualBox or Nvidia drivers may not be usable, although that may not be important, depending on your setup.

    <pre><code>lockdown=confidentiality</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">kernel lockdown LSM</a> can eliminate many methods that user space code could abuse to escalate to kernel privileges and extract
      sensitive information. This LSM is necessary to implement a clear security boundary between user space and the kernel. The above option enables this feature in confidentiality mode, the
      strictest option. This implies <code>module.sig_enforce=1</code>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>mce=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      This causes the kernel to panic on uncorrectable errors in ECC memory which could be exploited. This is unnecessary for systems without ECC memory.
    </p>

    <pre><code>quiet loglevel=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      These parameters prevent information leaks during boot and must be used in combination with the <code>kernel.printk</code> sysctl <a href="#sysctl-kernel">documented above</a>.

    <h4 id="cpu-mitigations"><a href="#cpu-mitigations">2.3.2 CPU mitigations</a></h4>

    <p>
      It is best to enable all CPU mitigations that are applicable to your CPU as to ensure that you are not affected by known vulnerabilities. This is a list that
      enables all built-in mitigations:
    </p>

    <pre><code>spectre_v2=on spec_store_bypass_disable=on tsx=off mitigations=auto,nosmt l1tf=full,force nosmt=force kvm.nx_huge_pages=force</code></pre>

    <p>
      You must research the CPU vulnerabilities that your system is affected by and apply a selection of the above mitigations accordingly. Keep in mind that you will
      need to <a href="#microcode"> install microcode updates</a> to be fully protected from these vulnerabilities. All of these may cause a significant performance decrease.

    <h3 id="hidepid"><a href="#hidepid">2.4 hidepid</a></h3>

    <p>
      <code>/proc</code> is a pseudo-filesystem that contains information about all processes currently running on the system. By default, this is accessible to all users, which
      can allow an attacker to spy on other processes. To permit users to only see their own processes and not those of other users, you must mount <code>/proc</code>
      with the <code>hidepid=2,gid=proc</code> mount options. <code>gid=proc</code> exempts the <code>proc</code> group from this feature so you can whitelist specific
      users or processes. One way to add these mount options is to edit <code>/etc/fstab</code> and add:
    </p>

    <pre><code>proc /proc proc nosuid,nodev,noexec,hidepid=2,gid=proc 0 0</code></pre>

    <p>
      systemd-logind still needs to see other users' processes, so for user sessions to work correctly on a systemd system, you must create

    <h3 id="kernel-attack-surface-reduction"><a href="#kernel-attack-surface-reduction">2.5 Kernel attack surface reduction</a></h3>

    <p>
      It is best to disable any functionality that is not absolutely required as to minimise potential kernel attack surface. These features do not necessarily have to be dangerous;
      they could simply be benign code that is removed to reduce attack surface. Never disable random things that you don't understand. The following are some examples that may be of
      use, depending on your setup.
    </p>

    <h4 id="kasr-boot-parameters"><a href="#kasr-boot-parameters">2.5.1 Boot parameters</a></h4>

    <p>
      Boot parameters can often be used to reduce attack surface. One such example is:
    <p>

    <pre><code>ipv6.disable=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      This disables the entire IPv6 stack which may not be required if you have not migrated to it. Do not use this boot parameter if you are using IPv6.
    </p>

    <h4 id="kasr-kernel-modules"><a href="#kasr-kernel-modules">2.5.2 Blacklisting kernel modules</a></h4>

    <p>
      The kernel allows unprivileged users to indirectly cause certain modules to be loaded via module auto-loading. This allows an attacker to auto-load a vulnerable
      module which is then exploited. One such example is <a href="https://github.com/xairy/kernel-exploits/tree/master/CVE-2017-6074">CVE-2017-6074</a>, in which an
      attacker could trigger the DCCP kernel module to be loaded by initiating a DCCP connection and then exploit a vulnerability in said kernel module. <br>
      <br>
      Specific kernel modules can be blacklisted by inserting files into <code>/etc/modprobe.d</code> with instructions on which kernel
      modules to blacklist. <br>
      <br>
      The <code>install</code> parameter tells <code>modprobe</code> to run a specific command instead of loading the module as normal. <code>/bin/false</code>
      is a command that simply returns <code>1</code>, which will essentially do nothing. Both of these together tells the kernel to run <code>/bin/false</code> instead of
      loading the module, which will prevent the module from being exploited by attackers. The following are kernel modules that are most likely to be unnecessary:
    </p>

    <pre><code>install dccp /bin/false

    <p>
      This disables the webcam to prevent it from being used to spy on you. <br>
      <br>
      You can also blacklist the microphone module; however, this can differ from system to system. To find the name of the module, look in <code>/proc/asound/modules</code>
      and blacklist it. For example, one such module is <code>snd_hda_intel</code>. <br>
      <br>
      Be aware though that sometimes the kernel module for the microphone is the same as the module for the speaker. This means that disabling the microphone like
      this may also inadvertently disable any speakers. Although <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1611/1611.07350.pdf">speakers can potentially be
      turned into microphones too</a>, so this isn't necessarily a negative outcome. <br>
      <br>
      It would be preferred to physically remove these devices or, at the very least, disable them in the BIOS / UEFI. Disabling the kernel modules is not as effective.

      Additionally, certain logging daemons, such as systemd's <code>journalctl</code>, include the kernel logs which can be used to bypass the above <code>dmesg_restrict</code> protection.
      Removing the user from the <code>adm</code> group is often sufficient to revoke access to these logs:
    </p>

    <pre><code>gpasswd -d $user adm</code></pre>

    <h3 id="restricting-sysfs"><a href="#restricting-sysfs">2.7 Restricting access to sysfs</a></h3>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/sysfs.html">sysfs</a> is a pseudo-filesystem which provides large quantities of kernel and hardware information. It is
      commonly mounted at <code>/sys</code>. sysfs has been the cause of <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2017/10/05/5">numerous information leaks, particularly
      of kernel pointers</a>. Whonix's <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc">security-misc package</a> includes the <a
      href="https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc/blob/master/usr/libexec/security-misc/hide-hardware-info">hide-hardware-info script</a>, which restricts access to this directory as well
      as a few in <code>/proc</code> in an attempt to hide potential hardware identifiers and prevent kernel pointer leaks. This script is configurable and allows <a
      href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Security-misc#Whitelisting_Applications">whitelisting specific applications based on groups</a>. It is recommended
      to apply this and make it execute on boot with an init script. For example, <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc/blob/master/lib/systemd/system/hide-hardware-info.service">this
      is a systemd service to do so</a>. <br>
      <br>
      For basic functionality to work on systems using systemd, you must whitelist a few system services. This can be done by creating <code>/etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d/sysfs.conf</code>
      and adding:
    </p>

    <pre><code>[Service]
SupplementaryGroups=sysfs</code></pre>

    <p>
      This will not fix everything though. Many applications may still break and it is up to you to whitelist them properly.
    </p>

    <h3 id="linux-hardened"><a href="#linux-hardened">2.8 linux-hardened</a></h3>

    <p>
      Certain distributions, such as Arch Linux, include a <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/linux-hardened/">hardened kernel package</a>. This contains
      many hardening patches and a more security-conscious kernel configuration. It is recommended to install this if possible.

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lkrg/">Linux Kernel Runtime Guard</a> (LKRG) is a kernel module which ensures kernel integrity at runtime and detects exploits. It can
      kill entire classes of kernel exploits; but it is not a perfect mitigation, as <a href="https://github.com/milabs/lkrg-bypass">LKRG is bypassable by design</a>. It is only
      suitable for off-the-shelf malware. However, while it is unlikely, LKRG may in itself expose new vulnerabilities like any additional kernel module.
    </p>

    <h3 id="kernel-self-compilation"><a href="#kernel-self-compilation">2.11 Kernel self-compilation</a></h3>

    <p>
      It is recommended to compile your own kernel whilst enabling as little kernel modules as possible and as many security features as possible to keep the attack surface of the kernel
      at an absolute minimum. <br>
      <br>
      In addition, apply kernel hardening patches, such as <a href="https://github.com/anthraxx/linux-hardened">linux-hardened</a> or <a href="https://grsecurity.net/">grsecurity</a>, as
      mentioned above. <br>
      <br>
      Distribution-compiled kernels also have public kernel pointers / symbols which are very useful for exploits. Compiling your own kernel will give you unique kernel symbols, which,
      along with <code>kptr_restrict</code>, <code>dmesg_restrict</code> and other hardening against kernel pointer leaks, will make it considerably harder for attackers to create exploits
      that rely on kernel pointer knowledge. <br>
      <br>
      You can take inspiration from or use Whonix's <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hardened-kernel">hardened-kernel</a> once it is complete to develop your kernel configuration.
    </p>

    <h2 id="mac"><a href="#mac">3. Mandatory access control</a></h2>

    <p>
      Mandatory access control (MAC) systems give fine-grained control over what programs can access. This means that your browser won't have access to your entire home directory or similarly. <br>
      <br>
      The most used MAC systems are SELinux and AppArmor. SELinux is a lot more secure than AppArmor, as it is more fine-grained. For example, it's inode-based rather than path-based, allows enforcing
      <a href="https://selinuxproject.org/page/ObjectClassesPerms">significantly stronger restrictions</a>, can <a href="https://kernsec.org/files/lss2015/vanderstoep.pdf">filter kernel ioctls</a>
      and much more. Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of being much more difficult to use and harder to learn, so AppArmor may be preferred by some. <br>
      <br>
      To enable AppArmor in the kernel, you must set the following <a href="#boot-parameters">boot parameters</a>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>apparmor=1 security=apparmor</code></pre>

    <p>
      To enable SELinux instead, set these parameters:
    </p>

    <pre><code>selinux=1 security=selinux</code></pre>

    <p>
      Keep in mind that simply enabling a MAC system won't by itself magically increase security. You must develop strict policies to fully utilise it. For example, to create
      AppArmor profiles, execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>aa-genprof $path_to_program</code></pre>

    <p>
      Open the program and start using it as you normally would. AppArmor will detect what files it needs to access and will add them to the profile if you choose. This alone will not
      be sufficient for high quality profiles though; seek the <a href="https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/Documentation">AppArmor documentation</a> for more details. <br>
      <br>
      If you want to take it a step further, you can setup a full system MAC policy that confines every single user space process by implementing an initramfs hook which enforces
      a MAC policy for the init system. This is how <a href="https://source.android.com/security/selinux">Android uses SELinux</a> and how <a
      href="https://github.com/Whonix/apparmor-profile-everything">Whonix will use AppArmor in the future</a>. This is necessary for enforcing a strong security model implementing the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least privilege</a>.

    <h2 id="sandboxing"><a href="#sandboxing">4. Sandboxing</a></h2>

    <h3 id="application-sandboxing"><a href="#application-sandboxing">4.1 Application sandboxing</a></h3>

    <p>
      A sandbox allow you to run a program in an isolated environment that has either limited access or none at all to the rest of your system. You can use these to secure applications or run untrusted programs. <br>
      <br>
      It is recommended to use <a href="https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap">bubblewrap</a> in a separate user account along with <a href="#mac">AppArmor or SELinux</a> to sandbox programs. You could also
      consider using <a href="#gvisor">gVisor</a> instead, which has the advantage of providing each guest with its own kernel. <br>
      <br>
      Either of these can be used to create a very powerful sandbox with minimal attack surface exposed. If you do not wish to create sandboxes yourself, consider using Whonix's <a
      href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Sandbox-app-launcher">sandbox-app-launcher</a> once it is complete. <a href="../linux.html#firejail">You should not use Firejail</a>. <br>
      <br>
      Container solutions, such as <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/">LXC</a>, are often used as a misguided form of sandboxing. These are too permissive as to support a
      wide variety of applications, so they cannot be considered a strong application sandbox.

      Ordinary sandboxes inherently share the same kernel as the host. You are trusting the kernel, which we have <a href="#kernel">already evaluated to be insecure</a>, to confine these programs properly. <a

    <h2 id="hardened-malloc"><a href="#hardened-malloc">5. Hardened memory allocator</a></h2>

    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/">hardened_malloc</a> is a hardened memory allocator that provides substantial
      protection from heap memory corruption vulnerabilities. It is heavily based on OpenBSD's malloc design but with numerous improvements. <br>
      <br>
      hardened_malloc can be used per-application via the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable. For example, assuming the library you
      have compiled is located at <code>/usr/lib/libhardened_malloc.so</code>, you can execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/libhardened_malloc.so" $program</code></pre>

    <p>
      It can also be used system-wide by globally preloading the library, which is the recommended way of using it. To do so, edit
      <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code> and insert:
    </p>

    <pre><code>/usr/lib/libhardened_malloc.so</code></pre>

    <p>
      hardened_malloc may break some applications, although the majority will work fine. If issues are experienced, it is recommended to compile
      hardened_malloc in its "light" configuration via the following build option in order to minimise breakage:
    </p>

    <pre><code>VARIANT=light</code></pre>

    <p>
      You should also set the following with <a href="#sysctl">sysctl</a> to <a

      Compiling your own programs can offer numerous benefits, as it gives you the ability to optimise your programs for security. However, it
      is easy to do the exact opposite and worsen security â€” if you are unsure about what you are doing, skip this section. This will be easiest
      on a source-based distribution, <a href="#choosing-the-right-distro">such as Gentoo</a>, but it is possible to do this on others. <br>
      <br>
      Certain compilation options can be used to add additional exploit mitigations that eliminate entire classes of common vulnerabilities.
      You have likely heard of regular protections, such as <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/Toolchain">Position Independent
      Executables, Stack Smashing Protector, immediate binding, read-only relocations and FORTIFY_SOURCE</a>, but this section will not
      go over those, as they have already been widely adopted. Instead, it will discuss <em>modern</em> exploit mitigations like Control Flow
      Integrity and shadow stacks. <br>
      <br>
      This section refers to native programs, written primarily in C or C++. You must be using the <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang
      compiler</a>, as most of these features <a href="https://outflux.net/slides/2019/lpc/gcc-and-clang.pdf">are not available on GCC</a>. Keep in
      mind that due to the lack of widespread adoption of these mitigations, certain applications may fail to function with them enabled.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li class="lilist">
        <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html">Control Flow Integrity</a> (CFI) is an exploit mitigation that <a
        href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2016/10/17/lets-talk-about-cfi-clang-edition/">aims to prevent code reuse attacks like ROP or JOP</a>.
        A large portion of vulnerabilities are exploited using these techniques due to more widely adopted mitigations, such as NX, making older
        exploit techniques obsolete. Clang supports fine-grained, forward-edge CFI, meaning that it effectively mitigates <em>JOP</em> attacks. Clang's
        CFI does not mitigate <em>ROP</em> by itself; you must also use a separate mechanism as documented below. To enable this, you must apply
        the following compilation flags:

        <pre><code>-flto -fvisibility=hidden -fsanitize=cfi</code></pre> <br>
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_stack">Shadow stacks</a> protect a program's return address by replicating it in a different,
        hidden stack. The return addresses in the main stack and the shadow stack are then compared in the function epilogue to see if either differ.
        If so, this would indicate an attack and the program will abort, therefore mitigating ROP attacks. Clang has a feature known as <a
        href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ShadowCallStack.html">ShadowCallStack</a> which accomplishes this, although it is only available on ARM64.
        To enable this, you must apply the following compilation flag:

        <pre><code>-fsanitize=shadow-call-stack</code></pre> <br>

        If the aforementioned ShadowCallStack is not an option, you can alternatively use <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SafeStack.html">

        variables to zero, as using other patterns is more suitable for bug finding than exploit mitigation. To enable this, you must apply the following
        compilation flag:

        <pre><code>-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero</code></pre> <br>

        If on Clang, you must also apply:

        An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow">integer overflow</a> is a class of vulnerabilities in which an arithmetic operation
        causes an integer value to exceed its maximum range, resulting in either the value wrapping around (in the case of unsigned integers) or causing
        undefined behaviour (in the case of signed integers). Clang's <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html">
        UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer</a> (UBSan) is designed to prevent many forms of undefined behaviour, including integer overflows. To enable Clang's
        integer sanitisation for both signed and unsigned integers, apply the following compilation flags:

        <pre><code>-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow,unsigned-integer-overflow -fsanitize-trap=signed-integer-overflow,unsigned-integer-overflow</code></pre> <br>

        Note that these options can cause a substantial performance regression. An alternative is to use the <code>-fwrapv</code> flag, which causes signed
        overflows to wrap rather than causing undefined behaviour, although this isn't as comprehensive as UBSan.

    <h2 id="root"><a href="#root">8. The root account</a></h2>

    <p>
      Root can do anything and has access to your entire system. Thus, it should be locked down as much as possible so attackers cannot easily gain root access.
    </p>

    <h3 id="securetty"><a href="#securetty">8.1 /etc/securetty</a></h3>

    <p>
      The file, <code>/etc/securetty</code> specifies where you are allowed to login as root from. This file should be kept empty so that nobody can do so from a terminal.
    </p>

    <h3 id="restricting-su"><a href="#restricting-su">8.2 Restricting su</a></h3>

    <p>
      <code>su</code> lets you switch users from a terminal. By default, it tries to login as root. To restrict the use of <code>su</code> to users within the <code>wheel</code> group, edit <code>/etc/pam.d/su</code> and
      <code>/etc/pam.d/su-l</code> and add:
    </p>

    <pre><code>auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid</code></pre>

    <p>
      You should have as little users in the <code>wheel</code> group as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="locking-root"><a href="#locking-root">8.3 Locking the root account</a></h3>

    <p>
      To lock the root account to prevent anyone from ever logging in as root, execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>passwd -l root</code></pre>

    <p>
      Make sure that you have an alternative method of gaining root (such as booting from a live USB and chrooting into the filesystem)
      before doing this so you do not inadvertently lock yourself out of the system.
    </p>

    <h3 id="denying-ssh-root-login"><a href="#denying-ssh-root-login">8.4 Denying root login via SSH</a></h3>

    <p>
      To prevent someone from logging in as root via SSH, edit <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> and add:
    </p>

    <pre><code>PermitRootLogin no</code></pre>

    <h3 id="increase-hashing-rounds"><a href="#increase-hashing-rounds">8.5 Increasing the number of hashing rounds</a></h3>

    <p>
      You can increase the number of hashing rounds that shadow uses, thereby increasing the security of your hashed passwords by
      forcing an attacker to compute substantially more hashes to crack your password. By default, shadow uses 5000 rounds, but you
      can increase this to as many as you want. Although the more rounds you configure, the slower it will be to login.
      Edit <code>/etc/pam.d/passwd</code> and add the rounds option. For example:
    </p>

    <pre><code>password required pam_unix.so sha512 shadow nullok rounds=65536</code></pre>

    <p>
      This makes shadow perform 65536 rounds. <br>
      <br>
      Your passwords are not automatically rehashed after applying this setting, so you need to reset the password with:
    </p>

    <pre><code>passwd $username</code></pre>

    <h3 id="restricting-xorg"><a href="#restricting-xorg">8.6 Restricting Xorg root access</a></h3>

    <p>
      Certain distributions run Xorg as the root user by default. This is an issue because Xorg contains a massive amount of ancient,
      complicated code, which adds huge attack surface and makes it more likely to have exploits that can gain root privileges.
      To stop it from being executed as root, edit <code>/etc/X11/Xwrapper.config</code> and add:
    </p>

    <pre><code>needs_root_rights = no</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="#gui-isolation">Alternatively, just switch to Wayland</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="accessing-root-securely"><a href="#accessing-root-securely">8.7 Accessing root securely</a></h3>

    <p>
      There are a <a href="../linux.html#root">wide range of methods that malware can use to sniff the password of the root account</a>. As such,
      traditional ways of accessing the root account are insecure. Preferably, root would not be accessed at all, but this isn't really feasible.
      This section details the safest way possible of accessing the root account. These instructions should be applied as soon as the OS is
      installed to make sure it is free of malware. <br>
      <br>
      You must not use your ordinary user account to access root, as it may have been compromised. You also must not log directly into the
      root account. Create a separate "admin" user account that is used solely for accessing root and nothing else by executing:
    </p>

    <pre><code>useradd admin</code></pre>

    <p>
      Set a very strong password by executing:
    </p>

    <pre><code>passwd admin</code></pre>

    <p>
      Allow <em>only</em> this account to use your preferred mechanism of escalating privileges. For example, if using <code>sudo</code>, add
      a sudoers exception by executing:
    </p>

    <pre><code>visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/admin-account</code></pre>

    <p>
      Now enter:
    </p>

    <pre><code>admin ALL=(ALL) ALL</code></pre>

    <p>
      Make sure that no other account has access to <code>sudo</code> (or your preferred mechanism). <br>
      <br>
      Now, to actually login to this account, reboot first â€” this prevents, for example, a compromised window manager from performing <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login_spoofing">login spoofing</a>. When provided with a login prompt, activate the <a
      href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SAK.txt">secure attention key</a> by pressing the following combination of keys on your
      keyboard:
    </p>

    <pre><code>Alt + SysRq + k</code></pre>

    <p>
      This will kill all applications on the current virtual console, therefore defeating login spoofing attacks. Now, you can safely login
      to your admin account and perform tasks using root. Once you are finished, log out of the admin account and log back in to your unprivileged
      user account.
    </p>

    <h2 id="firewalls"><a href="#firewalls">9. Firewalls</a></h2>

    <p>
      Firewalls can control incoming and outgoing network traffic and can be used to block or allow certain types of traffic. You
      should always block all incoming traffic unless you have a specific reason not to. It is recommended to set up a strict
      iptables or nftables firewall. Firewalls must be fine-tuned for your system, and there is not one ruleset that can fit all of them.
      It is recommended to get familiar with creating firewall rules. The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Iptables">Arch Wiki
      </a> and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables">man page</a> are both good resources for this. <br>
      <br>
      This is an example of a basic iptables configuration that disallows all incoming network traffic:
    </p>

    <pre><code>*filter
:INPUT DROP [0:0]
:FORWARD DROP [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:TCP - [0:0]
:UDP - [0:0]
-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP
-A INPUT -p udp -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j UDP
-A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j TCP
-A INPUT -p udp -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
-A INPUT -p tcp -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
-A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-proto-unreachable
COMMIT</code></pre>

    <p>
      You should not attempt to use this example on your actual system though. It is only suitable for certain desktop systems.

    <h3 id="mac-address-spoofing"><a href="#mac-address-spoofing">10.4 MAC address spoofing</a></h3>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">MAC addresses</a> are unique identifiers assigned to network interface controllers (NICs). Every time you
      connect to a network (e.g. WiFi or ethernet), your MAC address is exposed. This allows people to use it to track you and uniquely identify you on the local network. <br>
      <br>
      You should <strong>not</strong> completely randomise the MAC address. Having a completely random MAC address is obvious and will have the adverse effect of making you stand out.
      The OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) part of the MAC address identifies the chipset's manufacturer. Randomising this part of the MAC address may give you an OUI
      that has never been used before, hasn't been used in decades or is extremely rare in your area, therefore making you stand out and making it obvious that you are spoofing
      your MAC address. <br>
      <br>
      The end of the MAC address identifies your specific device and is what can be used to track you. Randomising only this part of the MAC address prevents you from being tracked
      whilst still making the MAC address seem believable. <br>
      <br>
      To spoof these addresses, first find out your network interface name by executing:
    </p>

    <pre><code>ip a</code></pre>

    <p>
      Next, install <a href="https://github.com/alobbs/macchanger">macchanger</a> and execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>macchanger -e $network_interface</code></pre>

    <p>
      To randomise the MAC address upon each boot, you should create an init script for your particular init system. This is an example of one for systemd:
    </p>

    <pre><code>[Unit]
Description=macchanger on eth0
Wants=network-pre.target
Before=network-pre.target
BindsTo=sys-subsystem-net-devices-eth0.device
After=sys-subsystem-net-devices-eth0.device

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/macchanger -e eth0
Type=oneshot

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>

    <p>
      The above example spoofs the MAC address of the <code>eth0</code> interface at boot. Replace <code>eth0</code> with your network interface.
    </p>

    <h4 id="time-synchronisation"><a href="#time-synchronisation">10.5.4 Time synchronisation</a></h4>

    <p>
      Time synchronisation is vital for anonymity and security. A wrong system clock can expose you to clock skew fingerprinting attacks or can be used to feed you outdated HTTPS
      certificates, bypassing certficate expiry or revocation. <br>
      <br>
      The most popular time synchronisation method, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a>, is insecure, as <a
      href="https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/863-Dont-update-NTP-stop-using-it.html">it is unencrypted and unauthenticated</a>,
      allowing an attacker to trivially intercept and modify requests. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905#page-23">NTP also leaks your local system time in NTP timestamp
      format</a>, which can be used for clock skew fingerprinting, as briefly mentioned before. <br>
      <br>
      Thus, you should uninstall any NTP clients and disable <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-timesyncd.service.html">systemd-timesyncd</a> if it is
      in use. Instead of NTP, you can connect to a trusted website over a secure connection (HTTPS or, preferably, a Tor onion service) and extract the current time from the HTTP header.
      Tools that accomplish this are <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Sdwdate">sdwdate</a> or my own <a href="https://gitlab.com/madaidan/secure-time-sync">secure-time-sync</a>.

      via your typing speed, pauses in between key presses, the exact time at which each key is pressed and released and so on. It is possible to test this online with <a
      href="https://www.keytrac.net/en/tryout">KeyTrac</a>. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak">kloak</a> is a tool that aims to defeat this method of tracking by obfuscating the time intervals between key press and release events.
      When a key is pressed, it introduces a random delay before it is picked up by the application. Although this may be frustrating for certain individuals and unsuitable for them. <br>

    <h2 id="file-permissions"><a href="#file-permissions">11. File permissions</a></h2>

    <p>
      By default, the permissions of files are quite permissive. You should search across your system for files and directories with improper permissions and restrict them. For example,
      on some distributions, such as Debian, users' home directories are world-readable. This can be restricted by executing:
    </p>

    <pre><code>chmod 700 /home/$user</code></pre>

    <p>
      A few more examples are <code>/boot</code>, <code>/usr/src</code> and <code>/{,usr/}lib/modules</code> â€” these contain the kernel image, System.map and various other files, all of
      which <a href="#other-kernel-pointer-leaks">can leak sensitive information about the kernel</a>. To restrict access to these, execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>chmod 700 /boot /usr/src /lib/modules /usr/lib/modules</code></pre>

    <p>
      On Debian-based distributions, the file permissions must be reserved with <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/buster/dpkg/dpkg-statoverride.1.en.html">dpkg-statoverride</a>. Otherwise,
      they will be overwritten during an update. <br>

    <h3 id="setuid"><a href="#setuid">11.1 setuid / setgid</a></h3>

    <p>
      setuid / SUID allows a user to execute a binary with the privileges of the binary's owner. This is often used to allow unprivileged users to utilise certain functionality that is normally
      only reserved for the root user. As such, many SUID binaries have a history of privilege escalation security vulnerabilities. setgid / SGID is similar but for groups rather than users. To
      find all binaries on the system with the setuid or setgid bit, execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>find / -type f \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \)</code></pre>

    <p>
      You should then remove any unnecessary setuid / setgid bits on programs you don't use, or replace them with <a href="#capabilities">capabilities</a>. <br>
      <br>
      To remove the setuid bit, execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>chmod u-s $path_to_program</code></pre>

    <p>
      To remove the setgid bit, execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>chmod g-s $path_to_program</code></pre>

    <p>
      To add a capability to the file instead, execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>setcap $capability+ep $path_to_program</code></pre>

    <p>
      To remove an unnecessary capability, execute:

    <h3 id="umask"><a href="#umask">11.2 umask</a></h3>

    <p>
      umask sets the default file permissions for newly created files. The default umask is <code>0022</code>, which is not very secure, as this gives read access to every user on the system for newly

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.linux-pam.org/">PAM</a> is a framework for user authentication â€” it's what you use when you login. You can make it more secure by requiring strong passwords or enforcing delays
      upon failed login attempts. <br>
      <br>
      To enforce strong passwords, you can use <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/pam_pwquality">pam_pwquality</a>. It enforces a configurable policy for passwords. For example, if
      you want passwords to contain a minimum of 16 characters (minlen), at least 6 different characters from the old password (difok), at least 3 digits (dcredit), at least 2 uppercase (ucredit), at least
      2 lowercase (lcredit) and at least 3 other characters (ocredit), then edit <code>/etc/pam.d/passwd</code> and add:
    </p>

    <pre><code>password required pam_pwquality.so retry=2 minlen=16 difok=6 dcredit=-3 ucredit=-2 lcredit=-2 ocredit=-3 enforce_for_root
password required pam_unix.so use_authtok sha512 shadow</code></pre>

    <p>
      To enforce delays, you can use <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam_faildelay.8.html">pam_faildelay</a>. To add a delay of at least 4 seconds between failed login attempts to deter
      bruteforcing attempts, edit <code>/etc/pam.d/system-login</code> and add:
    </p>

    <pre><code>auth optional pam_faildelay.so delay=4000000</code></pre>

    <p>
      These mount options should be set wherever possible in <code>/etc/fstab</code>. If you cannot use separate partitions, then create bind mounts. An example of a more secure <code>/etc/fstab</code>:

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(computing)">Entropy</a> is basically the randomness collected by an operating system and is crucial for things such as encryption.
      Hence, it is best to gather as much entropy as possible from a variety of sources by installing additional random number generators like <a href="http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/">haveged</a>
      and <a href="https://github.com/smuellerDD/jitterentropy-rngd">jitterentropy</a>. <br>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/rdrand">RDRAND</a> is a CPU instruction for providing random numbers. It is automatically used by the kernel as an entropy source if it is available;
      but since it is proprietary and part of the CPU itself, it is impossible to audit and verify its security properties. You are not even able to reverse engineer the code if you wish. This RNG

    <h2 id="editing-as-root"><a href="#editing-as-root">19. Editing files as root</a></h2>

    <p>
      It is unrecommended to run ordinary text editors as root. Most text editors can do much more than simply edit text files, and this can be exploited. For example, open <code>vi</code> as root and
      enter <code>:sh</code>. You now have a root shell with access to your entire system, which an attacker can easily exploit. <br>
      <br>
      A solution to this is using <code>sudoedit</code>. This copies the file to a temporary location, opens the text editor as an ordinary user, edits the temporary file and overwrites the original
      file as root. This way, the actual editor doesn't run as root. To use <code>sudoedit</code>, execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sudoedit $path_to_file</code></pre>

    <p>
      By default, it uses <code>vi</code>, but the default editor can be switched via the <code>EDITOR</code> or <code>SUDO_EDITOR</code> environment variables. For example, to use <code>nano</code>, execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>EDITOR=nano sudoedit $path_to_file</code></pre>

    <p>
      This environment variable can be set globally in <code>/etc/environment</code>.

    <p>
      Linux distributions often use HTTP or a mixture of HTTP and HTTPS mirrors by default to download packages from their software repositories. People assume this is fine because
      package managers verify the signatures of packages before installation. However, historically, <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/news/2021/03/19/qsb-067/">there</a> <a

      Full-disk encryption ensures that all data on your drive is encrypted and cannot be read by a physical attacker. Most distributions support enabling encryption during installation. Make sure you set a
      strong password. You can also encrypt your drive manually with <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt">dm-crypt</a>. <br>
      <br>
      Be aware that full-disk encryption does not cover <code>/boot</code>. As such, it is still possible to modify the kernel, bootloader and other critical files. To fully protect against tampering, you
      must also implement <a href="#verified-boot">verified boot</a>.

    <h3 id="bios-uefi"><a href="#bios-uefi">21.2 BIOS / UEFI hardening</a></h3>

    <p>
      If you are still using legacy BIOS, then you should migrate to UEFI as to take advantage of newer security features. <br>
      <br>
      Most BIOS or UEFI implementations support setting a password. It is best to enable this and set a very strong password. This is a weak protection though, as it is trivial to reset the password. It is
      often stored in volatile memory, so an attacker just needs to be able to remove the CMOS battery for a few seconds, or they can reset it with a jumper on certain motherboards. <br>
      <br>
      You should also disable all unused devices and boot options, such as USB booting, to reduce attack surface. <br>
      <br>
      Updating the BIOS or UEFI is often neglected â€” make sure you keep them updated. Treat it as important as regular operating system updates. <br>

    <h3 id="bootloader-passwords"><a href="#bootloader-passwords">21.3 Bootloader passwords</a></h3>

    <p>
      The bootloader executes very early in the boot process and is responsible for loading your operating system. It is very important that you protect your bootloader. Otherwise, it can be tampered
      with â€” for example, a local attacker can easily gain a root shell by using <code>init=/bin/bash</code> as a kernel parameter at boot, which tells the kernel to execute <code>/bin/bash</code> instead
      of your normal init system. You can prevent this by setting a password for your bootloader. <br>
      <br>
      Setting a bootloader password alone is not enough to fully protect it. You must also setup verified boot <a href="#verified-boot">as documented below</a>.
    </p>

    <h4 id="grub"><a href="#grub">21.3.1 GRUB</a></h4>

    <p>
      To set a password for GRUB, execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2</code></pre>

    <p>
      Enter your password and a string will be generated from that password. It will be something like "grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.C4009...". Create <code>/etc/grub.d/40_password</code> and add:
    </p>

    <pre><code>set superusers="$username"
password_pbkdf2 $username $password</code></pre>

    <p>
      Replace "$password" with the string generated by <code>grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2</code>. "$username" will be for the superusers that are permitted to use the GRUB command line, edit menu entries,
      and execute any menu entry. For most people, this will just be "root". <br>
      <br>
      <a href="#regenerate-grub-config">Regenerate your configuration file</a> and GRUB will now be password protected. <br>

      To restrict only editing the boot parameters and accessing the GRUB console whilst still allowing you to boot, edit <code>/boot/grub/grub.cfg</code> and next to "menuentry '$OSName'", add
      the "--unrestricted" parameter. For example:
    </p>

    <pre><code>menuentry 'Arch Linux' --unrestricted</code></pre>

    <h4 id="syslinux"><a href="#syslinux">21.3.2 Syslinux</a></h4>

    <p>
      Syslinux can either set a master password or a menu password. A master password is required for booting any entry, while a menu password is only required for booting a specific entry. <br>
      <br>
      To set a master password for Syslinux, edit <code>/boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg</code> and add:
    </p>

    <pre><code>MENU MASTER PASSWD $password</code></pre>

    <p>
      To set a menu password, edit <code>/boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg</code> and within a label that has the item you want to password protect, add:
    </p>

    <pre><code>MENU PASSWD $password</code></pre>

    <p>
      Replace "$password" with the password you wish to set. <br>
      <br>
      These passwords can either be plaintext or hashed with MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 or SHA-512. It is recommended that you hash your password with a strong hashing algorithim like SHA-256 or SHA-512
      first to avoid storing it in plaintext.

    <p>
      <a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/">Verified boot</a> ensures the integrity of the boot chain and base system by cryptographically verifying them. This can be used to
      ensure that a physical attacker cannot modify the software on the device. Without verified boot, all of the precautions mentioned above could be bypassed with ease once physical access is
      gained. Contrary to common assumptions, verified boot is not just important for physical security â€” it prevents the persistence of <strong>any</strong> tampering with your system, be it from
      a physical attacker or a malicious application that has managed to hook itself into the operating system. For example, if a remote attacker has managed to exploit the system and gain high
      privileges, verified boot would revert their changes upon reboot and ensure that they cannot persist. <br>
      <br>
      The most common verified boot implementation is <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000006942/boards-and-kits/desktop-boards.html">UEFI Secure Boot</a>. However,
      this by itself is not a complete implementation, as this only verifies the bootloader and kernel, meaning there are ways to bypass this:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li class="lilist">
        UEFI secure boot alone lacks an immutable root of trust, so a physical attacker can still reflash the firmware of the device. To mitigate this, use UEFI secure boot in combination with <a

      <li class="lilist">
        A remote attacker (or a physical attacker when not using <a href="#encryption">encryption</a>) can simply modify any other privileged part of the operating system. For example, if they have
        the privileges to modify the kernel, then they'd also be able to modify <code>/sbin/init</code> to achieve effectively the same result. Thus, only verifying the kernel and bootloader will not
        do anything against a remote attacker. To mitigate this, you must verify the base operating system with <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/verity.html">
        dm-verity</a>, although this is very difficult and cumbersome due to the layout of traditional Linux distributions.

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMA_attack">Direct memory access (DMA) attacks</a> involve gaining complete access to all of system memory by inserting certain physical devices. This can be

    <p>
      A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack">cold boot attack</a> occurs when an attacker analyses the data in RAM before it is erased. When using modern RAM, cold boot attacks aren't
      very practical, as RAM usually clears within a few seconds or minutes unless it has been placed inside a cooling solution, such as liquid nitrogen or a freezer. An attacker would have to rip out the RAM
      sticks from your device and expose it to liquid nitrogen all within a few seconds and without the user noticing. <br>
      <br>
      If cold boot attacks are part of your threat model, then guard your computer for a few minutes after shutdown to ensure that nobody has access to your RAM sticks. You could also solder the RAM sticks into your
      motherboard to make it harder for them to be seized. If using a laptop, take out the battery and run directly off the charging cable. Pull out the cable after shutdown to ensure that the RAM has no access to
      more power to stay alive. <br>
      <br>
      In the <a href="#boot-kernel">kernel self-protection boot parameters section</a>, the zeroing of memory at free time option will overwrite sensitive data in memory with zeroes. Furthermore, the <a
      href="#hardened-malloc">hardened memory allocator</a> can purge sensitive data within user space heap memory via the <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc#configuration">CONFIG_ZERO_ON_FREE
      configuration option</a>. Despite these though, some data may still remain in memory. <br>
      <br>
      Additionally, modern kernels include a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/730006/">reset attack mitigation</a>, which commands the firmware to erase data upon shutdown, although this requires <a
      href="https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/Platform-Reset-Attack-Mitigation-Specification.pdf">firmware support</a>. <br>
      <br>
      Make sure that you shutdown your computer normally, so the mitigations explained above can kick in. <br>
      <br>
      If none of the above are adequate for your threat model, you can implement <a href="https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/memory_erasure/">Tails' memory erasure process</a>, which erases the majority of
      memory (with the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/support/known_issues/index.en.html#video-memory">exception of video memory</a>) and has been proven to be effective.

      Despite the hardening you have done, you must remember that <a href="../linux.html">Linux is still a fundamentally flawed operating system</a>, and no amount of hardening can ever fix it fully.

      You should perform as much varied research as possible and not rely on a single source of information. One of the largest security problems is the user. These are links to other guides that I find valuable:

    <p>
      You may need to regenerate your GRUB configuration to apply certain changes you have made to the bootloader. The steps to do this can sometimes differ
      between different distributions. For example, on distributions such as Arch Linux, you are expected to regenerate your configuration file by executing:
    </p>

    <pre><code>grub-mkconfig -o $path_to_grub_config</code></pre>

    <p>
      "$path_to_grub_config" depends on how you have setup your system. It is often either <code>/boot/grub/grub.cfg</code> or <code>/boot/EFI/grub/grub.cfg</code>,
      but you should make sure before executing this command. <br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, on distributions like Debian or Ubuntu, you should execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>update-grub</code></pre>

    <h3 id="capabilities"><a href="#capabilities">Capabilities</a></h3>

    <p>
      In the Linux kernel, "root privileges" are split up into various different <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</a>. This
      is helpful in applying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least privilege</a> â€” instead of giving a process total root
      privileges, you can grant them only a specific subset instead. For example, if a program simply needs to set your system time, then it only needs <code>CAP_SYS_TIME</code>
      rather than total root. This could limit the potential damage that can be done; however, you must still be cautious with granting capabilities, as <a
      href="https://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?t=2522">many of them can be abused to gain full root privileges anyway</a>.
