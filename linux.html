  <h1>Linux</h1>

  <p>
    Due to inevitable pedanticism, "Linux" in this article refers to a standard Linux or GNU/Linux distro.
  </p>

  <h2 id="linux-insecurity"><a href="#linux-insecurity">Linux (in)security</a></h2>

  <p>
    There is a common assumption that Linux is a very secure operating system. This is very far from the truth for
    various different reasons. <br>
    <br>
    There is no strong sandboxing in the standard desktop. This means all applications have access to each other’s data
    and can snoop on your personal information. Most programs are written in memory unsafe languages such as C or C++
    which has been the cause of <a
      href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/16/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">the majority of
      discovered security vulnerabilities</a> and modern exploit mitigations such as Control-Flow Integrity are not
    widely used. <br>
    <br>
    The kernel is also very lacking in security. It is a monolithic kernel written entirely in a memory unsafe language
    and has hundreds of bugs, many being security vulnerabilities, <a
      href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Syzbot-and-the-Tale-of-Thousand-Kernel-Bugs-Dmitry-Vyukov-Google.pdf">found
      each <i>month</i></a>. In fact, there are so many bugs being found in the kernel, developers can’t keep up which
    results in many of the bugs <a href="https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream">staying unfixed for a long time</a>.
    The kernel is also <a href="https://jon.oberheide.org/files/syscan12-exploitinglinux.pdf">decades behind in exploit
      mitigations</a> and many kernel developers simply <a
      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/11/05/net-of-insecurity-the-kernel-of-the-argument/">do not
      care enough</a>. <br>
    <br>
    On ordinary desktops, a compromised non-root user account with access to <code>sudo</code> is <a
    href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation">almost equal to full
    root compromise</a> as there are too many ways for an attacker to retrieve the sudo password. Usually, the standard user
    is part of group <code>sudo</code> which makes this a massive issue and makes a sudo password almost security
    theater. For example, the attacker can exploit the plethora of keylogging opportunities such as <a
      href="https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/04/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html">X’s lack of GUI
      isolation</a>, the <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/05/3">many infoleaks in
      <code>/proc</code></a>, use <a href="https://github.com/Aishou/wayland-keylogger"><code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to hook
      into every process</a> and so much more. Even if we mitigate every single way to log keystrokes, the attacker can
    just setup their own fake sudo program to grab the user password. <br>
    <br>
    This is all it takes to get your <code>sudo</code> password:
    <pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;\EOF > /tmp/sudo
#!/bin/bash
if [[ "${@}" = "" ]]; then
  /usr/bin/sudo
else
  read -s -r -p "[sudo] password for ${USER}: " password
  echo "${password}" > /tmp/password
  echo -e "\nSorry, try again."
  /usr/bin/sudo ${@}
fi
EOF
chmod +x /tmp/sudo
export PATH="/tmp:${PATH}"</code></pre>
    <br>
    Or:
    <pre><code>xinput list # find your keyboard ID
xinput test id # replace "id" with the ID from the above command</code></pre>
    <br>
    etc. <br>
    <br>
    Now the attacker is just a <code>modprobe</code> away from full kernel privileges.
  </p>

  <h2 id="hardening"><a href="#hardening">"But I harden my system!"</a></h2>

  <p>
    Standard system hardening is not enough to fix any of these massive architectural security issues. Restricting a few
    minor things is not going to fix this. Likewise, a few common security features distros deploy by default is also
    not going to fix this. Just because your distro enables a MAC framework without creating a strict policy and still
    running most processes unconfined, doesn't mean you can escape from these. <br>
    <br>
    The hardening required for a reasonably secure Linux distro is far greater than people assume. You will need full
    system MAC policies, full verified boot (not just the kernel but the entire base system), a strong sandboxing
    architecture, a hardened kernel, widespread use of modern exploit mitigations and plenty more.

  <h3 id="flatpak"><a href="#flatpak">Flatpak</a></h3>

  <p>
    Flatpak aims to sandbox applications but <a href="https://flatkill.org/">its sandboxing is very flawed</a>. It fully
    trusts the applications and allows them to specify their own policy. This means security is optional and apps can
    just choose not to be sufficiently sandboxed. <br>
    <br>
    Flatpak's permissions are also far too broad to be meaningful. For example, many applications come with
    <code>filesystem=home</code> which is read-write access to the user's home directory, giving access to all of your
    personal files and allowing trivial escapes via writing to <code>~/.bashrc</code> or similar. <br>
    <br>
    Another example of Flatpak's broad permissions is how it allows unfiltered access to the X11 socket, allowing easy
    escapes due to X11's lack of GUI isolation. Adding X11 sandboxing via a nested X11 server such as Xpra is easy but
    Flatpak developers refuse to acknowledge this and continue to claim <a
      href="https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2015/02/17/first-fully-sandboxed-linux-desktop-app/">"X11 is impossible to
      secure"</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Even more examples of this is how Flatpak gives full access to directories such as <code>/sys</code> or
    <code>/proc</code> (kernel interfaces known for information leaks). <br>
    <br>
    <i>Another</i> example is how the seccomp filter <a
      href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/blob/f687f6b2ebfe9bc69f59e42bb96475ca01f08548/common/flatpak-run.c#L2646-L2693">
    only blacklists ~20 syscalls</a>.
