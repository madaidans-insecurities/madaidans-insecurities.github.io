  <p>
    Despite popular belief, OpenBSD's security is actually lacking in a lot of ways.
  </p>

  <h2 id="half-baked-mitigations"><a href="#half-baked-mitigations">Half-Baked Mitigations</a></h2>

  <p>
    Many of OpenBSD's exploit mitigations are half-baked or even useless. This is a non-exhaustive list of a few
    of them.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="lilist">
      One of OpenBSD's popular features is its <a href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20160527203200">"W^X"</a>
      however, OpenBSD's W^X is not a complete implementation — it does <a href="https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/9f25ea04447">
      prevent a process from creating a memory mapping with both writable and executable permissions</a>, but it does not prevent
      a process from transitioning a writable memory mapping to executable. This means that it's not very hard to bypass. <br>
      <br>
      An attacker can simply write code to a writable memory mapping, create a ROP chain to transition the mapping to executable and
      then execute their shellcode from there. Many exploits in the wild have been shown to do this instead of purely relying on ROP
      since that takes more effort. <br>
      <br>
      Complete W^X implementations are already found in other operating systems like <a
      href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/02/23/mitigating-arbitrary-native-code-execution/">Windows'
      ACG</a>, <a href="https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1902/en_US/apple-platform-security-guide.pdf#page=109">iOS' code
      signing</a> and so on. <a
      href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1562410493-8661-1-git-send-email-s.mesoraca16@gmail.com/">Even Linux is working on it with
      the S.A.R.A. LSM</a>, albeit a few decades late. The idea of W^X was not novel to OpenBSD either — the first complete implementation
      was <a href="https://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/mprotect.txt">present in PaX</a> ~20 years ago which itself has roots in the
      <a href="https://www.openwall.com/linux/">OpenWall project</a>.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      Another of OpenBSD's mitigations is <a href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20170622065629">TRAPSLED</a>.
      This aims to neutralise NOP sleds, but this mitigation <a
      href="https://isopenbsdsecu.re/mitigations/trapsled/">doesn't really do
      anything since the adoption of ASLR</a>. TRAPSLED can be useful for some non-security use cases, but it is absolutely
      not an exploit mitigation.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=150317547021396&w=2">RETGUARD</a> is a supposed mitigation against ROP,
      but it <a href="https://twitter.com/lazytyped/status/899173090550312961">is trivially bypassed with an arbitrary read</a>.
      It is not a solid mitigation for ROP unlike proper mitigations, such as <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ShadowCallStack.html">
      Clang's ShadowCallStack</a>, <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/4d/2a/control-flow-enforcement-technology-preview.pdf">
      Intel CET shadow stacks</a>, <a href="https://grsecurity.net/rap_faq">PaX RAP</a>, etc. Meaningful defenses against ROP are again, already found in
      other operating systems like <a
      href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-kernel-internals/understanding-hardware-enforced-stack-protection/ba-p/1247815">
      Windows' CET</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preparing_your_app_to_work_with_pointer_authentication">iOS'
      PAC</a> and <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/queue-hardening-enhancements.html">Android's ShadowCallStack</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="missing-mitigations"><a href="#missing-mitigations">Missing Mitigations</a></h2>

  <p>
    As well as developing half-baked mitigations, OpenBSD also lacks plenty of modern mitigations completely. Again, this is a
    non-exhaustive list and there are still plenty more examples than the ones listed here.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="lilist">
      OpenBSD has no reliable protection against code reuse attacks. It only has a few mitigations that aren't very effective
      as discussed above. It lacks both forward and backward-edge protection. Meanwhile, Windows has a coarse-grained, forward-edge
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity">Control Flow Integrity</a> (CFI) implementation known as
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard">Control Flow Guard</a> as well as
      backward-edge protection via <a
      href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/4d/2a/control-flow-enforcement-technology-preview.pdf">
      Intel CET's shadow stacks</a>; iOS and M1 Macs use an <a
      href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preparing_your_app_to_work_with_pointer_authentication">
      improved implementation of ARM's Pointer Authentication Codes</a> (PAC), ensuring
      backward and forward-edge protection; Android <a
      href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/06/compiler-based-security-mitigations-in.html">uses Clang's
      fine-grained, forward-edge CFI</a> and <a
      href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/queue-hardening-enhancements.html">ShadowCallStack</a>.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      <a href="android.html#unlocking-the-bootloader">Verified boot</a> is an important security feature that eliminates privileged
      malware persistence by verifying the integrity of the entire base operating system. This is most commonly used on mobile devices
      with <a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/">Android</a> and <a
      href="https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1902/en_US/apple-platform-security-guide.pdf#page=30">iOS</a> both having solid
      implementations, but desktop operating systems have made substantial progress on this as well; mainly <a
      href="https://support.apple.com/en-jo/HT208330">macOS</a>, <a
      href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/03/17/secured-core-pcs-a-brief-showcase-of-chip-to-cloud-security-against-kernel-attacks/">
      Windows</a> and <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/verified-boot">ChromeOS</a>, whereas any
      form of verified boot is nonexistent on OpenBSD.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      <a href="http://phrack.org/issues/52/6.html#article">Trusted Path Execution</a> (TPE) prevents an attacker from executing arbitrary code
      from the filesystem and can be used as a supplement to proper W^X to prevent dynamic native code execution in both memory and the
      filesystem, but — like the lack of actual W^X — OpenBSD also has no TPE.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      OpenBSD has no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control">Mandatory Access Control</a> (MAC) system like
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor">AppArmor</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux">
      SELinux</a> which prevents you from fully locking down user space. In comparison to, for example, Android in which it uses a
      <a href="https://source.android.com/security/selinux/">strict, full system SELinux policy</a> to confine every single process in
      user space and is a core part of the security model. Pledge and Unveil, while being great sandboxing tools, are not a replacement
      for a proper MAC system. It still fully trusts the applications as it has to be implemented within its source code and it isn't
      nearly as fine-grained as a good SELinux setup.
    </li>

    <li class="lilist">
      OpenBSD also lacks any form of GUI isolation which will make sandbox escapes incredibly easy. It uses <a
      href="https://www.xenocara.org/">Xenocara</a>, a fork of X11 which is
      notorious for being insecure and <a
      href="https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/04/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html">not implementing GUI isolation</a>
      and OpenBSD does not support <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="lack-of-innovations"><a href="#lack-of-innovations">Lack of Innovations</a></h2>

  <p>
    OpenBSD hasn't really innovated much and many of its (real) mitigations were developed long before OpenBSD implemented them, such as W^X
    and ASLR which <a href="https://pax.grsecurity.net/">were developed by PaX</a> (PAX_MPROTECT and PAX_ASLR). OpenBSD tries to hide
    this fact with sly wording, such as: <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/innovations.html">"ASLR: OpenBSD 3.4 was the first widely used
    operating system to provide it by default."</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="good-things"><a href="#good-things">The Good Things</a></h2>

  <p>
    Although despite the many issues with it, some of OpenBSD's mitigations are pretty solid like <a
    href="https://ftp.openbsd.org/papers/eurobsdcon2009/otto-malloc.pdf">their malloc implementation</a> and OpenBSD excels in their
    cryptography and standalone tools, just not really when it comes to general OS security.

  <h2 id="alternative"><a href="#alternative">Alternative</a></h2>

  <p>
    A more promising alternative to OpenBSD is <a href="https://hardenedbsd.org/">HardenedBSD</a>. There are
    advantages and disadvantages of HardenedBSD over OpenBSD. HardenedBSD has many mitigations OpenBSD does not, such as CFI,
    SafeStack, SEGVGUARD, a proper W^X implementation and more, but it lacks things OpenBSD has, such as LibreSSL, a
    hardened memory allocator, etc.
