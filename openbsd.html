  <h1>OpenBSD</h1>

  <p>
    OpenBSD is lacking in a lot of ways. Many of its exploit mitigations are half-baked/useless such as its <a
      href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20160527203200">W^X</a> which can be bypassed by transitioning a
    writable memory mapping to executable or <a
      href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20170622065629">TRAPSLED</a> which doesn't actually make
    exploitation harder in the era of ASLR. <br>
    <br>
    OpenBSD is also missing many important security features such as <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity">Control-Flow Integrity</a>, <a
      href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SafeStack.html">SafeStack</a> or <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ShadowCallStack.html">
      ShadowCallStack</a> (<a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=150317547021396&w=2">RETGUARD</a> is not a replacement
    for CFI or SafeStack/ShadowCallStack since it only covers backward edges and is <a
      href="https://isopenbsdsecu.re/mitigations/retguard/">bypassed with a single information leak</a>), <a
      href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/">verified boot</a>, <a
      href="http://phrack.org/issues/52/6.html#article">Trusted Path Execution</a> and a lot more. OpenBSD hasn't
    innovated much and many of its (real) mitigations were developed long before OpenBSD implemented them such as W^X
    and ASLR which <a href="https://pax.grsecurity.net/">were developed by PaX</a> (PAX_MPROTECT and PAX_ASLR). <br>
    <br>
    Although, some of OpenBSD's mitigations are pretty solid like <a href="https://ftp.openbsd.org/papers/eurobsdcon2009/otto-malloc.pdf">
    their malloc implementation</a>. <br>
    <br>
    OpenBSD has a non-existent application security model. It does not have any MAC implementation to fully lock down
    userspace and lacks any GUI isolation. It uses <a href="https://www.xenocara.org/">Xenocara</a>, a fork of X11 and
    does not support <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a>. <br>
    <br>
    OpenBSD has received criticism from many respected security experts. One example is <a
      href="https://grsecurity.net/~spender/exploits/exp_moosecox.c">Brad Spengler</a>, the developer of grsecurity.
    <br>
    <br>
    This website goes in-depth into the issues with most of OpenBSD's mitigations: <a
      href="https://isopenbsdsecu.re/">https://isopenbsdsecu.re/</a> <br>
    <br>
    A more promising alternative to OpenBSD is <a href="https://hardenedbsd.org/">HardenedBSD</a>. There are
    advantages/disadvantages of HardenedBSD over OpenBSD. HardenedBSD has many mitigations OpenBSD does not such as CFI,
    SafeStack, SEGVGUARD, a proper W^X implementation and more but it lacks things OpenBSD has such as LibreSSL, a
    hardened malloc etc.
