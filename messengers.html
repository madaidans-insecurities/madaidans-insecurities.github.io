  <h2 id="telegram"><a href="#telegram">Telegram</a></h2>

  <p>
    <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> is <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#q-why-not-just-make-all-chats-secret">not end-to-end encrypted by default</a>, which allows the
    Telegram server to see all of your messages unless you use a "Secret Chat". Telegram uses <a href="https://core.telegram.org/mtproto">custom, unaudited encryption</a>, and the first
    version of MTProto had <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1177.pdf">severe security issues</a>, although these were fixed with MTProto 2.0. However, Telegram still uses strange
    cryptographic primitives, such as AES-IGE, for "performance", although they use it in a way that they <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#q-why-not-just-make-all-chats-39secret-39">aren't
    affected by its known security issues</a>. Telegram has also been criticised by well-known cryptographers, such as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6913456">Moxie
    Marlinspike</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/726428912968982529">Matthew Green</a> and <a
    href="https://buttondown.email/cryptography-dispatches/archive/cryptography-dispatches-the-most-backdoor-looking/">Filippo Valsorda</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Telegram has <a href="https://telegram.org/crypto_contest">held crypto cracking contests</a>, but these <a href="https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/1998/1215.html#contests">
    were</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/SIl9M">rigged</a>. Although the <a href="https://telegram.org/apps#source-code">clients are open source</a>, the server is not, so self-hosting
    is not a possibility. The creators of Telegram have also <a href="https://twitter.com/durov/status/872891017418113024">spread unfounded misinformation</a> about competing
    apps before. <br>
    <br>
    Telegram, along with most other messengers, leak significant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a> about your messages, even if the message itself was end-to-end
    encrypted.
  </p>

  <h2 id="silence"><a href="#silence">Silence</a></h2>

  <p>
    <a href="https://silence.im">Silence</a> is dead, and the only commits for a long time <a href="https://git.silence.dev/Silence/Silence-Android/-/commits/master">have been translations</a>,
    not code updates.
  </p>

  <h2 id="wire"><a href="#wire">Wire</a></h2>

  <p>
    <a href="https://wire.com/en/">Wire</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gvzw5x/secure-messaging-app-wire-stores-everyone-youve-ever-contacted-in-plain-text">stores all metadata
    unencrypted on their servers</a>, although <a href="https://github.com/wireapp/wire/issues/214">there are plans to correct this</a>. Unlike Telegram, however, <a
    href="https://wire.com/en/security/#audits">Wire has been audited</a>, and its server code is <a href="https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server">fully open source</a>, allowing it to be self-hosted.
  </p>

  <h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>

  <p>
    Use <a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a>. It <a href="https://www.signal.org/docs/">uses the gold standard of encryption</a>, <a href="https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/">conceals
    metadata well</a>, <a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/eastern-virginia-grand-jury/">has a great track record</a>, is recommended by countless experts in the field and more. Most other
    messengers are subpar.
