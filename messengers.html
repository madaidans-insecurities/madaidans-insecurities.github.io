  <h1>Messengers</h1>

  <h2 id="telegram"><a href="#telegram">Telegram</a></h2>

  <p>
    <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> is <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#q-why-not-just-make-all-chats-secret">not end-to-end encrypted by default</a>, allowing the
    Telegram server to see all of your data unless you use a "Secret Chat". Telegram uses <a href="https://core.telegram.org/mtproto">custom, unaudited encryption</a>. The first
    version of MTProto had <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1177.pdf">severe security issues</a> but these were fixed with MTProto 2.0. Telegram uses odd cryptographic
    primitives such as AES-IGE for "performance" although they use it in a way that they <a href="https://core.telegram.org/techfaq#q-do-you-use-ige-ige-is-broken">aren't affected
    by its security issues</a>. Telegram has also been criticized by well known cryptographers such as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6913456">Moxie Marlinspike</a>
    and <a href="https://nitter.net/matthew_d_green/status/726428912968982529">Matthew Green</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Telegram has <a href="https://telegram.org/crypto_contest">held crypto cracking contests</a> but these <a href="https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/1998/1215.html#contests">
    were</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/SIl9M">rigged</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Although the <a href="https://telegram.org/apps#source-code">clients are open source</a>, the server is not. <br>
    <br>
    The creators of Telegram have <a href="https://nitter.net/durov/status/872891017418113024">spread baseless misinformation</a> about competing apps before. <br>
    <br>
    Telegram, along with most other messengers, leak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a> about your messages, even if the message itself was end-to-end
    encrypted.
  </p>

  <h2 id="silence"><a href="#silence">Silence</a></h2>

  <p>
    <a href="https://silence.im">Silence</a> is dead and the only commits for a long time <a href="https://git.silence.dev/Silence/Silence-Android/-/commits/master">have been translations</a>,
    not code updates.
  </p>

  <h2 id="wire"><a href="#wire">Wire</a></h2>

  <p>
    <a href="https://wire.com/en/">Wire</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gvzw5x/secure-messaging-app-wire-stores-everyone-youve-ever-contacted-in-plain-text">stores all metadata
    unencrypted</a> and is <a href="https://www.thinkprivacy.ch/cutting-the-wire">owned by a US company</a>, a country known for privacy abuses. <br>
    <br>
    Unlike Telegram however, Wire <a href="https://wire.com/en/security/#audits">has been audited</a> and its server code is <a href="https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server">fully
    open source</a>, allowing it to be self-hosted.
  </p>

  <h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>

  <p>
    Use <a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a>. It <a href="https://www.signal.org/docs/">uses solid encryption</a>, has <a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/eastern-virginia-grand-jury/">a
    great track record</a>, is recommended by many experts in the field and a lot more. Most other messengers are subpar.
